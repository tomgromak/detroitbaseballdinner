        <p class="bBallText">One of the Tigers' fan-favorites from their 2012 World Series season highlights the 12th annual Detroit Baseball Dinner, a warm and intimate evening of friendship, fellowship and baseball set for 6 p.m., Jan. 28, at The Townsend Hotel, 100 Townsend St., in Birmingham.</p>

       </div><p></p>
        <p class="bBallText">Quintin Berry, an outfielder whose fleet ways and early-season hitting helped the Tigers to a long post-season run, is the second recipient of The Tenth Man Award, presented by The Detroit Baseball Society. The award honors a Tigers player who is not typically a lineup regular but whose contributions made him particularly valuable during the previous season.<br>
          <br>
          Berry will be joined by a traditional group of Tigers executives and staffers, highlighted by Dave Dombrowski, the Tigers president, general manager and CEO. The evening begins with a 6 p.m. cocktail hour, followed by a full-course dinner prepared by The Townsend's chef and staff. 
          <br>
          A post-dinner program famed for its variety and conversation will again include remarks and wit from Dave Chilton, the Waterloo, Ontario, author of "The Wealthy Barber" book series whose insights on the Tigers and on baseball at-large have made him a dinner tradition.<br>
          <br>
          The $125 ticket price includes hors d'oeuvres, dinner and great conversation. A discounted room rate at The Townsend is also available for those who care to turn a grand evening into a longer weekend. Dinner reservations can be made by calling 248-562-7130.</p>
        <p class="bBallStyle">Why a Baseball Dinner?</p>
        <p class="bBallText">Times and traditions change. Media members, particularly,
          recall that late January was, for years, a special time on Detroit’s
        baseball calendar.</p>
        <p class="bBallCtr"><img src="files/tigers-aj-1.jpg" width="550" height="321"></p>
        <p class="bBallText"> A lavish Thursday evening party sponsored by the
          Detroit Tigers was always one of the winter’s classy affairs.
          One night later it was customary for the Detroit Baseball Writers to
          convene for dinner and conversation with Tigers brass, the team’s
          manager, assorted players, etc., as part of an unofficial beginning
          to the upcoming baseball season.<br>
          <br>
          With the passing of those events more than a decade ago, a void was
          created. Detroit lacked a prime-time, baseball-flavored gathering.
          The community needed a get-together that would be an antidote to winter’s
          doldrums and double as a good reason to get people together for an
          evening of pleasure and camaraderie, all with an eye toward the start
          of spring training.<br>
          <br>
          Other big-league cities (Chicago, New York, Boston, etc.) all had winter
          baseball dinners. Why shouldn’t one be held in one of the best
          and oldest baseball towns in America?<br>
          <br>
          It was a nagging thought that gave birth in February of 2002 to the
          first annual Detroit Baseball Dinner.</p>
        <p class="bBallCtr"><img src="files/2.jpg" width="448" height="500"></p>
        <p class="bBallStyle">About the Dinner</p>
        <p class="bBallText">That a baseball community as rich and as historic as Detroit’s
          should celebrate its heritage by doing what baseball has always succeeded
          best in achieving over 150 years in America -- bringing people
          together in a spirit of pleasure and friendship so that a common interest,
          baseball, can be celebrated and shared.<br>
          <br>
          The dinner’s component parts are simple: warm conversation, the
          sharing of food and drink, the exhilaration of welcoming the coming
          spring and the start of baseball season.<br>
          <br>
	    The Detroit Baseball Dinner gave birth in 2003 to The Detroit Baseball Society, which is devoted to year-round activities and conviviality among those who love baseball in Detroit. Its president is Steve Clarfelt (248-701-4800). New members are always welcome as an evolving baseball community continues to enjoy the flavor and experiences associated with Detroit's baseball heritage.</p>
