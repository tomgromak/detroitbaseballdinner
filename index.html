        <p class="bBallStyle">13th annual dinner set for 6 P.M., Jan. 25, 2014, at Bloomfield Hills Country Club</p>
        <p class="bBallText">Don Kelly, the Tigers handyman who contributed at six different positions and whose bat and speed became occasional difference-makers in 2013, will be the Tigers player headliner at the 14th Annual Detroit Baseball Dinner, set for 6 p. m., Jan. 25, 2014, at Bloomfield Hills Country Club.</p>

       </div><p></p>
        <p class="bBallText">Kelly is a second-time recipient of The Tenth Man Award, presented by The Detroit Baseball Society. The award honors a Tigers player who is not typically a lineup regular but whose contributions made him particularly valuable during the previous season.<br>

Kelly, who won the inaugural Tenth Man Award in 2012, will be joined by a traditional group of Tigers executives and staffers, highlighted by Dave Dombrowski, the Tigers president, general manager and CEO. The evening begins with a 6 p. m. cocktail hour, followed by a full-course dinner.<br>

The post-dinner program is spiced by variety and by a Q-and-A conversation with Dave Dombrowski. Dave Chilton, the Waterloo, Ontario, author of "The Wealthy Barber," will offer insights on the Tigers and on baseball at-large.<br>

The $150 ticket price now includes a two-drink open bar during hors d’oeuvres. Dinner, including wine, and great conversation follow. Dinner reservations can be made by calling 248-562-7130.</p>
        <p class="bBallStyle">Why a Baseball Dinner?</p>
        <p class="bBallText">Times and traditions change. Media members, particularly,
          recall that late January was, for years, a special time on Detroit’s
        baseball calendar.</p>
        <p class="bBallCtr"><img src="/files/IMG_0192-575.jpg" alt="IMG_0192-575" width="575" height="354" /></p>
        <p class="bBallText"> A lavish Thursday evening party sponsored by the
          Detroit Tigers was always one of the winter’s classy affairs.
          One night later it was customary for the Detroit Baseball Writers to
          convene for dinner and conversation with Tigers brass, the team’s
          manager, assorted players, etc., as part of an unofficial beginning
          to the upcoming baseball season.<br>
          <br>
          With the passing of those events more than a decade ago, a void was
          created. Detroit lacked a prime-time, baseball-flavored gathering.
          The community needed a get-together that would be an antidote to winter’s
          doldrums and double as a good reason to get people together for an
          evening of pleasure and camaraderie, all with an eye toward the start
          of spring training.<br>
          <br>
          Other big-league cities (Chicago, New York, Boston, etc.) all had winter
          baseball dinners. Why shouldn’t one be held in one of the best
          and oldest baseball towns in America?<br>
          <br>
          It was a nagging thought that gave birth in February of 2002 to the
          first annual Detroit Baseball Dinner.</p>

        <p class="bBallStyle">About the Dinner</p>
        <p class="bBallText">That a baseball community as rich and as historic as Detroit’s
          should celebrate its heritage by doing what baseball has always succeeded
          best in achieving over 150 years in America -- bringing people
          together in a spirit of pleasure and friendship so that a common interest,
          baseball, can be celebrated and shared.<br>
          <br>
          The dinner’s component parts are simple: warm conversation, the
          sharing of food and drink, the exhilaration of welcoming the coming
          spring and the start of baseball season.<br>
          <br>
	    The Detroit Baseball Dinner gave birth in 2003 to The Detroit Baseball Society, which is devoted to year-round activities and conviviality among those who love baseball in Detroit. Its president is Steve Clarfelt (248-701-4800). New members are always welcome as an evolving baseball community continues to enjoy the flavor and experiences associated with Detroit's baseball heritage.</p>
